Building Node Generation Algorithm
----------------------------------

The aim of this algorithm is to create a node from a way that
represents a building so that it can be added to the named_nodes
array and display information about that building when clicked.

Criteria for a building way =
	- Is a way
	- Has tag "name"
	- Has tag "building"

When a building way is found during the process of converting the ways
into quick ways:
	1. Get the first, last, and middle nodes of that way's
		coordinates.
	2. Calculate the centre point of the triangle that is formed
		when you connect the first, last, and middle nodes.
	3. Create a node with no ID, using the centre point of that
		triangle as its coordinates and the way's tags as 
		its own tags.
	4. Add the node into named_nodes along with the ID of the
		"building node" colour group.

These building nodes will then be treated like any other named node.
(I.e. they will be rendered onto the map and the user will be able to
interact with them via mouse-clicks to see information about them.)
