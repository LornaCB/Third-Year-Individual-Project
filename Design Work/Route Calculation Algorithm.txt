Simple Route Calculation Algorithm
----------------------------------

I will probably not implement route calculation into the actual application, but I may make a
proof of concept program to demonstrate the idea if I have time. I might also be nice to show
off such an algorithm when talking about improvements that could be made to the application in
the future.

Changes to initial map load:

	- When loading the ways, identify which nodes are used in more than one way. Add the ID/
		coordinates of these nodes and the IDs of the ways that they connect to an array.

Actual algorithm:

	1. Get desired starting point. Get desired ending point.

	2. Get the ID of the ways closed to the starting and ending points respectively.

	3. Use that new array from map load to find a series of intersections that will 
		connect the starting way to the ending way.

	4. Draw a line from the starting point to each of the intersecting nodes 
		(along their respective ways) to the ending point. (Could draw a way 
		starting from the first intersecting node to the next intersecting node, 
		identifying each node by its coordinates - as you will be using quick ways, 
		not regular ways.)

I assume that finding the correct series of intersections may require some fancy graphing 
algorithms and other optimisations that work around the fact that JavaScript only supports
single-threading.
