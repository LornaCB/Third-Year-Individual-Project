Map App IndexedDB Structure
---------------------------

	Logic
	-----

Each piece of OSM data is its own JSON object.
Each piece of OSM data must be placed into a separate array based on its type.
Each chunk of OSM data (from a single query) can be saved into the database.
The cached chunk should be retrievable by name (or some other index).
There should be room for more than one cached chunk.

"Quick Ways" is used to render ways more quickly. The user can choose whether to
store this in the database to shorten the initial map loading time, or to leave
this empty to use less memory.

	Structure
	---------

IndexedDB = {
	"Cached Data" : [
		{
			"Name" : NAME OF DATA STORE,
			"Description" : DESCRIPTION OF DATA STORE,
			"Data" :  {
					"Nodes" : [
						OSM JSON DATA GOES HERE
					],
					"Ways" : [
						OSM JSON DATA GOES HERE
					],
					"Rels" : [
						OSM JSON DATA GOES HERE
					],
					"Quick Ways" : [
						[WAY ID, [WAY COORDINATES]]
					]
			}
		}
	]
}

"Cached Data" is an IndexedDB object store. Its keyPath is "Name".
