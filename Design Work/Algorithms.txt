Rendering the Map
-----------------

Receive data from backend (in form of 3 arrays [nodes], [ways], [areas])
Go through the list of nodes
	LOOP START
	Draw each node
	LOOP END
Go through the list of ways
	LOOP START
	Draw each way
	LOOP END
Go through the list of areas
	LOOP START
	Draw each area
	LOOP END

(Note : The data is passed through from the backend using Flask's render_template
parameters, which replaces placeholders in the HTML file with actual data.)

Create JSONObject out of cache name, cache desc., OSM data
Put JSONObject into "Cached Data" object store
