Map Colours
-----------

In order for the map to be easier to read, elements that represent
different things should have different colours. For example: A river
should be drawn differently to a footpath - as, otherwise, someone
may perceive it as something they could walk upon, and use it in
route-planning.

I will store the colours for each feature of the map in a JSON object
called "colour_scheme". I will store the colours as rgba hex values.

	Nodes
	-----

Not sure what to do with nodes yet. I think I'll just make them
purple by default, for now.

	Ways
	----

Ways have many tags that can determine how they should be drawn.
For example: The tag "waterway" indicates that the way is made
out of water, and should be drawn blue. I will detail a number
of these tags and their values below:

- tag:highway, value =
	- motorway = red
	- trunk = red
	- primary = red
	- secondary = red
	- tertiary = red
	- unclassified = red

	- residential = orange
	- living_street = orange

	- service = dark red
	- busway = dark red

	- pedestrian = light brown
	- footway = light brown
	- bridleway = light brown
	- steps = light brown
	- cycleway = light brown

For other values, use grey. I have grouped values together
because I would run out of obviously-different colours if
I tried to give each one its own. I will store them in the
colour scheme as so:

	"busy car roads" = red
	"residential roads" = orange
	"restricted access roads" = dark red
	"pedestrian roads" = light brown
	"other" = grey

There is also the matter of railways. I don't feel the need
to differentiate between railways, so I shall make every way
with the tag "railway" pink.

Labels should be white with a black outline so that they are
visible on all colours.

OSM also has a different thickness for each type of highway, so
that's an improvement to consider for another time.

- tag:building = dark grey

I don't feel the need to differentiate between buildings, so
they'll be stored as:

	"building" = dark grey

- tag:landuse, value =
	- aquaculture = dark blue

	- allotments = dark green
	- farmland = dark green
	- vineyard = dark green

	- recreation_ground = light green
	- village_green = light green
	- flowerbed = light green
	- plant_nursery = light green
	- grass = light green
	- meadow = light green

	- forest = medium green
	- orchard = medium green

	- cemetery = light grey

- tag:natural, value =
	- water = light blue
	- bay = light blue
	- strait = light blue

	- grassland = light green
	- shrubbery = light green
	- tundra = light green

	- heath = medium green
	- scrub = medium green
	- tree_row = medium green
	- wood = medium green

	- beach = yellow

	- glacier = very light blue

	- mud = dark brown
	- wetland = dark brown

- tag:waterway = light blue

These shall be polygons with the given fill.
I'll store these as:

	"commercial water" = dark blue
	"natural water" = light blue
	"commercial vegetation" = dark green
	"heavy vegetation" = medium green
	"light vegetation" = light green
	"sand" = yellow
	"ice" = very light blue
	"mud" = dark brown
